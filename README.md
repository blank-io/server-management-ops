## Overview
This repository serves as a practical portfolio of **Systems Administration** and **DevOps** automation. It moves beyond theory to demonstrate working, production-ready code for managing Linux infrastructure.

The project is structured into four distinct levels of complexity, evolving from basic shell scripting to full-scale container orchestration and Continuous Integration (CI/CD).

## Projects Included
1. **Shell Automation**: Scripts for routine system maintenance and health checks.
2. **Web Server Configuration**: Nginx setup with reverse proxy and security best practices.
3. **System Monitoring**: A Python-based tool to log CPU and Memory usage.
4. **Containerization**: Deploying a multi-container stack using Docker Compose.

## Technologies
* **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS)
* **Scripting**: Bash, Python
* **Web**: Nginx
* **Tools**: Docker, Systemd
